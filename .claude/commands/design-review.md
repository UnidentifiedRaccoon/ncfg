You are running a UI/UX design review for this Next.js website.

Scope:
- Review the page(s) the user mentions (or the current route if running locally).
- Check Desktop / Tablet / Mobile responsiveness.
- Focus on: hierarchy, typography, spacing, grid, components, accessibility, perceived performance, visual polish.

Process:
1) Ask for the URL/route if not provided.
2) If local run is possible, run the dev server and verify route renders.
3) Produce findings grouped by severity:
   - Blockers (must fix)
   - Important (should fix)
   - Polish (nice to have)
4) For each finding include:
   - what is wrong
   - why it matters
   - a concrete fix suggestion (design + implementation hint)
5) End with a short “diff plan”: the smallest set of changes that improves the page most.

Output in Russian. No fluff.

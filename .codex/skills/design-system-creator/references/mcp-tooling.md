# MCP Tooling (Optional)

Keep this out of `SKILL.md` to avoid loading it unless the user explicitly wants MCP-assisted workflows.

## When to use MCP here

- You have a Figma file and need exact colors/typography/spacing extracted.
- You want fast scaffolding of standard components before refining.
- You want to look up best-practice references quickly.

## Typical flow

1. Extract exact values from design sources (e.g., Figma variables).
2. Build token tiers (primitive -> semantic -> component).
3. Scaffold components if needed, then refactor to match tokens.
4. Validate docs + states + a11y.

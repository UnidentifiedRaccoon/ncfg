# Web Design Trends and Traps

Load this file only when you need a quick reminder of modern patterns and what commonly looks dated.

## Trend evolution (rough)

- 2019-2021: subtle shadows, layering, early dark mode mainstreaming
- 2022-2023: oversized typography, variable fonts, bento/grid-heavy layouts
- 2024+: bento grids, grain/noise textures, richer motion systems, personalization

## Common traps (often suggested by older examples)

- Flat design with zero depth and zero hierarchy.
- Hero sliders and carousels for primary messaging.
- Desktop hamburger menus without a strong reason.
- Low-contrast light gray on white for body text.

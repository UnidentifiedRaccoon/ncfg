description: Competitive landscape mapping and positioning strategy: define the space, identify players, map them on 2D axes, find white space, and recommend differentiation. Use for \"how do I stand out?\" and competitive positioning in crowded markets.

# Competitive Cartographer

## Inputs I Need

- Domain and offering (what is being sold/shipped)
- Target audience and buying context
- Known competitors (3-20) or permission to discover them
- Constraints (budget, team size, time, existing brand/position)
- What decision this should enable (positioning, messaging, roadmap focus)

## Outputs I Will Produce

- A competitor list (direct, adjacent, aspirational) with short notes
- A 2D map proposal (axes + placement rationale)
- White space opportunities (viable + defensible)
- Recommended positioning:
  - headline/one-liner
  - 3-5 differentiators
  - what to avoid (me-too cluster)

## Workflow

1. Define the competitive space precisely (narrow enough to be useful).
2. Gather players:
   - direct competitors
   - adjacent substitutes
   - aspirational references
3. Extract signals (taglines, features, pricing posture, visual language).
4. Choose axes that reveal tradeoffs (not vanity axes).
5. Map and cluster; identify:
   - crowded zones
   - under-served edges
   - intersection gaps
6. Recommend a positioning that fits constraints and can be executed.
7. If exporting a map artifact, validate with `scripts/validate_map.sh`.

## Quality Bar

- The map is decision-oriented (it changes what we do next).
- White space is actionable, not imaginary.
- Positioning is consistent with constraints (team/time/credibility).

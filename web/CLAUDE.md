# Commands

- `npm run dev`: Run the project
- `npm run lint`: Run the style and type checker
- `npm run test`: Run tests (prefer single test files for speed)

# Code style

- See `components/Button.tsx` for canonical component structure

# Workflow

- Always typecheck after making a series of code changes
- API routes go in `app/api/` following existing patterns
